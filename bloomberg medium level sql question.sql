BLOOMBERG STOCK ANALYSIS â€“ HIGHEST AND LOWEST OPEN PRICES BY MONTH
===============================================================================

Problem Statement:
------------------
You are a Data Analyst at Bloomberg with access to historical stock data for 
FAANG companies. The goal is to find, for each stock (ticker symbol):

1. The month and year ('Mon-YYYY') where the stock had its **highest opening price**.
2. The month and year ('Mon-YYYY') where the stock had its **lowest opening price**.

Return:
--------
ticker | highest_mth | highest_open | lowest_mth | lowest_open

The results should be sorted by ticker symbol.

===============================================================================
TABLE SCHEMA:
===============================================================================

CREATE TABLE stock_prices (
    date        TIMESTAMP,
    ticker      VARCHAR(10),
    open        DECIMAL(10, 2),
    high        DECIMAL(10, 2),
    low         DECIMAL(10, 2),
    close       DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

Example Data:
--------------
 date                | ticker |  open  |  high  |  low   | close
